# portfolio-webpage

This first version of the PatrickDev14 portfolio webpage is a first time applying a dark mode style.

## future version

Future coding should work on-
* spacing between text lines
* more detailed header
* positioning the profile pic to the right side of the section container with contact info
* fix link color for email popouts?
